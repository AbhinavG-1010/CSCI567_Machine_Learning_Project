# Complex Regularization Techniques for Image Classification and Sequence Labelling

## Project Overview

This project explores complex regularization techniques applied to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The techniques include L2 Regularization, Dropout, Data Augmentation, and Ensemble Regularization (Dropout + L2). The project uses the Tiny-ImageNet dataset and focuses on preventing overfitting.
